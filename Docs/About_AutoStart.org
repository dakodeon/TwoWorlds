* ABOUT AUTOSTART

There are three types of autostart used:

** Run a script at boot

Both Node.js instances are run this way (=webosc= and =piratebox=)

This is done by placing a script file in =/etc/init.d=.

Also relevant here is the auto login option:
This can be found in the file: =/etc/inittab=. From the same file we start two terminal instances (=tty1= and =tty2=).

** Run a script at user login

This is used to start Supercollider in =tty2=.

It is done by adding the relevant code in the file =~/.bashrc=.

** Start a program in Desktop

This is used to autostart the web browser with the secret school home page.

Note: We are using LXDE Desktop.

Add the relevant code in the file =/etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE/autostart= or in =/etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart=. Not sure which one it is.
